## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

It seems counter intuitive, but digital video provides a simple path for integrating digital composing into a class. Traditionally, video production required costly equipment and high levels of technical competency. In the last two decades, however, the barriers have decreased dramatically. We might trace some of this shift to attempts to strip motion picture production to its essentials. The Dogme films, *The Celebration* (1998) and *The Idiots* (1998), were each shot entirely with prosumer grade digital video cameras. The broader public experienced a similar shift with the introduction of Apple’s iMovie (1999), the development of smart phones, and the creation of YouTube (2005). Today, creating and distributing digital videos presents no more (and sometimes fewer) challenges than developing websites, composing podcasts, or designing visuals with image editors.

One response to this growth of digital video has been to seek resonances between video production and writing in general. From this perspective, the process(es) of video production and writing largely remediate and support each other. Here we see an embrace of the traditional documentary form and its related genres, such as the cinematic essay, as in films like Barbara Kopple’s *Hoop Dreams* (1994) or Morgan Spurlock’s reality-television-esque *Super Size Me* (2004). We might call this approach the “audio-visual writing” perspective. Within this perspective, rhetoric comes to the fore as the attendant pedagogies foreground concepts like audience, purpose, genre, and medium. This perspective embodies what John Tinnell calls a “digital tools” approach through which video technologies are largely understood as something to be harnessed for the goals of rhetorical intent (123). This position, however, generally conflates analog and digital moving image-making processes. The digital simply provides a level of ease and access unavailable to the general public in the age of celluloid motion pictures.

Another response is to see digitization as creating entirely new possibities for what constitutes the moving image and its channels for communication. From this perspective, we see an embrace of alternative modes of messaging, algorithmic processes, and networks of circulation. We loosely call this perspective “post-cinematic,” an approach oriented more toward working beyond the symbolic and even beyond the capacities for human perception. Examples include the creation and distribution of moving images in social media networks, Florian Thalhofer’s Korsakow system (an algorithmically driven program for creating films), the virtual cameras of digitally rendered game spaces, the myriad CCTV cameras and networks in our worlds, and even the movements on our smart phone and desktop screens. A pedagogical embrace of the post-cinematic is concerned not only with how new technologies expand a tool kit for composing but also with how the technologies themselves create new forms and exert agency in the composition and pedagogical scenario.

Ultimately we see audio-visual writing and the post-cinematic less as strict oppositions and more as overlapping pedagogical orientations that both yield important payoffs. While engaging with either mode, students deal directly with concerns of intellectual property. They experiment with a range of literacies and composing strategies that engage the alphabet, sound, visuals, and motion. They also consider human-technology relations. And they find high levels of engagement and motivation in activities as they rise to new intellectual challenges and work in ways that resonate with their daily lives.

Given these familiar and experimental possibilities combined with the increasing ease of creating video projects, it’s  surprising that there is not more widespread adoption of video assignments as part of digital pedagogy. In some ways, this can be explained by the expectations for production values associated with digital video. If we conceive of digital video assignments in terms of film production, then we are confronted with the need for cameras, microphones, lighting, editing, and a good deal of time learning these processes. Additionally, as we move away from the relatively stable ground of film production into the realms of smartphone cameras, screen capturing, game spaces, and algorithms, we risk feeling lost in the more ephemeral, even autopoetic, qualities of a digitally networked composing. A more productive approach to video in digital pedagogy is to work somewhere between these two extremes. By lowering the entry difficulties to creating video projects but maintaining reasonable expectations for production quality (easily accomplished with prosumer technologies and basic instruction) and by embracing a willingness to experiment with video as something more than just a user-friendly means of extending traditional writing, we can create more opportunities for integrating digital video in our classrooms.

* Creators: Cate Blouke, Lisa Gulesserian, Jenny Howell, Rachel Mazique, Scott Nelson, Sarah Riddick, Michael Roberts, Laura Thain, and Beck Wise (University of Texas at Austin)

This collection in the lesson plan archive of UT-Austin’s Digital Writing and Research Lab (DWRL) offers assignments that range from doing rhetorical analysis of short videos to disputing YouTube content takedowns to using juxtapositions in video mash-ups. Lessons offer clearly articulated pedagogical goals, technological requirements, suggestions for evaluation, and even “timeline[s] for optimal use” within a curriculum. The lesson plans are pitched for both instructors and students who are novice readers and makers of video. For instance, in the lesson, “Transforming Video with Popcorn Maker,” by Beck Wise, students are introduced to visual rhetoric as well as to an example of a web-based tool for remixing existing video content on the web. For more experienced instructors and students, lessons such as these provide a nice starting point for thinking about the goals and technologies for video-making within the context of more recent phenomena in video-making and culture. Beyond the “video” tag, the DWRL’s Lesson Plan archive contains a wealth of starting point lessons related to many other themes relevant to the reception and making of video and moving images.

*The Jump* provides a venue for video projects and a space for reflecting on the pedagogical dimensions of those projects. Geared toward student multimedia, *The Jump* is a great resource for instructors interested in pursuing undergraduate research. Each published project is accompanied by an author’s statement that includes not only details on the technologies used to create projects but also reflections on the composing process. Publications also include a good deal of the pedagogical materials that support the student projects: assignments, details about the course, *etc*. And each project is accompanied by an instructor reflection, offering more details about the pedagogical dimensions of the projects. Every issue of *The Jump* contains a variety of projects ranging from webtexts to remix videos, and each is rich with reflections and assignment materials. Of particular interest are projects such as Megan Cross’s “Re-Presentation: Kate Chopin’s The Story of an Hour.” This project, a video made with PowerPoint, introduces (or reminds) us that when we talk about video we are not simply talking about iMovie or cameras. Many contemporary compositional tools can be appropriated for working with the moving image. This resource can be used as a venue that might provide an end-goal for video assignments. It also provides a wealth of student examples and sample instructional materials.

Todd Taylor’s ENGL 318 course site features materials related to the production of student documentaries during the Fall 2014 iteration of the course. Taylor’s work with video focuses primarily on the documentary form. Like the work of Bump Halbritter (see “Big Questions, Small Works, Lots of Layers” below), the strength of Taylor’s pedagogy is that it successfully situates the students within a generative sweet spot of aiming for high-production values, but with an equal emphasis on ease of entry into unfamiliar technological territory. The work that emerges from Taylor’s class provides a real sense of what’s possible for undergraduate video-makers with reasonable access to prosumer technologies and a developing sense rhetorical purpose.

### "DV Lab: Documenting Science through Video and New Media"

An entry to the archive of course materials made available through MIT’s Open Courseware, “DV Lab: Documenting Science through Video and New Media,” outlines an undergraduate level course offering a way into thinking about the intersection of science and technology studies and documentary film practice. This course might be of particular interest to those wishing to integrate video-making and analysis into a curriculum oriented toward knowledge-making within the disciplines. Included in this resource are a collection of both lecture and media lab videos. Lectures cover topics such as “Documentary and Ways of Seeing,” while lab videos address topics such as “Introduction to the Camera” and “Interviewing Techniques.” Additionally, this course contains materials that deal with the ethics and legality of documentary film work, including items on “best practices in fair use” and a piece titled, “The Photographer’s Right.” The site also provides easy navigation to other film and video related courses in the MIT archive via a helpful “Related Content” tab on course home page. We see two potential uses for this site. First, we teach in a writing program that focuses on the exploration of genres in the context of their relation to academic disciplines, so we find the conceptual orientation of this course helpful in designing how we might integrate a video unit focused on composing into the natural sciences. Second, while the lecture and lab videos are long, they do provide ample introduction for the instructor of the kinds of issues that arise when having students do documentary work. Additionally, sample student projects like “Playformed” demonstrate what is possible for student video-makers without relying on strictly professional exemplars.

### "MediaComp"

* Creators: Daniel Anderson and students (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)

MediaComp is a website for a course focused on new media composing. As we offered in our curatorial statement, working pedagogically with video involves at least two overlapping perspectives: one, an audio-visual writing approach that scaffolds working with video as an extension of the foundational lessons of writing; the other, a post-cinematic orientation that views video as not simply a more user-friendly tool kit for audio-visual work. This course reflects this overlap. On the one hand, assignments such as the “Video Essay” attempt to support student media projects though the use of familiar academic expectations as “being informed by research” and being “constructed with the aim of providing information and guidance about the topic to viewers.” Here, the more generic goals of academic writing are understood to be applicable for making video essays. On the other hand, the course also attempts to complicate our notions of how video communicates via projects that utilize the social video applications of Vine and Instagram. While the aim of the Vine/Instagram project (i.e., to make “a small collection of videos that make a statement about a topic or create a connection with a group of people”) does not sound too far removed from the goals of writing in general, working with these emerging technologies requires a more overt and explicit experimentation with the constraints and affordances of the software (the agency of technology itself) rather than the assumption that the technology can offer a relatively transparent way of making meaning for an audience. In addition to these projects, the site also collects a number of video reflections where students use screen capture to discuss their composing processes. (More of these kinds of video reflections are captured in the essay, “This is What We Did in Our Class,” listed in the additional resource section below.)

### "Filmic Texts and the Rise of the Fifth Estate"

* Source URL: <http://scalar.usc.edu/anvc/kuhn/index>
* Copy of Artifact: forthcoming
* Creator: Virginia Kuhn (University of Southern California) and the *International Journal of Learning and Media*

This online text captures and reports on the work of a class: IML 340: "The Praxis of New Media." The focus is on the intellectual components of digital video, especially the argumentative and rhetorical affordances of video modes and their connections to digital literacy. The entire collection of materials is helpful, but of particular interest is the strand on digital pedagogy. From underlying course philosophies to technical concerns of processing and hosting videos to issues of intellectual property, the piece takes up pedagogical components of working with video in both practical and conceptual ways. Particularly valuable within the Digital Pedagogy thread is Kuhn’s discussion of a digital argument, which she defines as an argument “that is born-digital and uses the various affordances of emergent technologies intentionally.” Additionally, Kuhn challenges the notion that audio-visual media are too ephemeral for sustained analysis, arguing that digitization allows for the "patience that books possess." Overall, for instructors who fear the more whimsical or seemingly disposable nature of digital culture, Kuhn’s commitment to the rigors of reading and writing with media will prove a valuable resource for reflecting on the intellectual benefits and challenges of doing work with video. Finally, Kuhn’s use of the Scalar platform for publication of the work&mdash;while itself not taking full advantage of many of the notational features of the Scalar system&mdash;does invite speculation towards the role that such platforms might play in video work, in terms of both delivery and analysis.

### "Teaching Resources for Video and Emerging Media"

Jennifer Proctor’s “Teaching Resources” page offers a range of materials capturing a variety of moments in video-making and culture. Assignments move from more traditional forms of audio-visual work, such as storyboarding, to more contemporary genres, such as vlogs and mash-ups, toward still in-process materials related to emerging web-based video applications, such as Vine and Zeega. The value of Proctor’s site lies in its offering of the raw materials of her digital pedagogy, but also in that her pedagogy very much looks ahead to web-based, networked video-making. For example, included here are a “Loop Assignment” using GIFs and Vines, and an “Augmented Reality Assignment” using the Aurasma platform. While we have not specifically utilized Proctor’s materials in our own courses, we have found ourselves increasingly beginning to incorporate things such as Vine into course offerings focused on networked and multimodal composing. What makes video-making in Vine intriguing is that, like other acts of video-making, its products can be queried on the grounds of the rhetorical intentionality and the choices of the video-maker; however, the constraints imposed by the Vine application (e.g., videos are limited to seven seconds, and each seven-second video plays back on a loop) complicates attempts to strictly understand Vine within the context of more traditional notions of videography. For example, as students become more proficient in the use of traditional video-making interfaces such as digital cameras and non-linear editors, they tend to experience a sense of expanded possibility in what they might compose, express, or argue with these possibilities. They feel limited only by considerations of a sense of purpose and audience. Indeed, this developed sense of expanded possibility within rhetorical constraints is often a primary goal of pedagogies concerned with multimodality. When students begin working with the constrained loops of Vine, however, the agencies of things like the Vine application itself and the smartphone used to capture the video potentially come as much to the fore as the rhetorical agency of the video-maker. This can be frustrating for the student who has come to understand the software and hardware of video-making as simply a tool to be harnessed in the service of rhetorical goals. Pedagogically, then, the challenge becomes that we not simply dismiss applications like Vine as one more tool in the composer’s toolbox. They might offer a way of thinking about the variety of actors and agencies at work in a given situation.

### "Post-Industrial Video 0.5"

* Creator: Adrian Miles (RMIT University, Melbourne)

With this site Adrian Miles presents his curriculum for “post-industrial video.” In the broadest sense, post-industrial video designates a video production practice enabled by the digitization of and increased access to the means of audio-visual production. For Miles, however, the notion of post-industrial video also designates an even more profound shift from hardcopy paradigms of media production to what he terms softcopy forms, or those enabled by the development of digital networks. At the heart of this curriculum is Miles’s pedagogical experiment(s) with the interactive video system, Korsakow. However, given that the site both makes available Miles’s teaching philosophy and outlines the specific tasks and forms of assessment for the post-industrial video classroom, this site could prove valuable in developing curricular experiments with any emerging, web-specific video application, such as Zeega, Storyplanet, Kylnt, 3W Doc, *et al.* In short, Miles glosses his curriculum as “where video is no longer looking backwards to its industrial restrictions of limited access and linear, single broadcast.” As we have previously mentioned, the notion of an expansion of the previously restricted access to video production ungirds almost all discussion of video and digital pedagogy. What makes Miles's curricular experiments valuable is the additional layer of not simply looking back to the analogue restriction of having to make a video that, despite the potential for structuring content nonlinearly, remains bound to a linear timeline for its delivery. Put another way, Miles's curricular experiments demand that we ask what it means to make video within the material constraints and affordances of digital networks in which the paradigms of print literacy might be an insufficient guide. The answer to this question is of course complex, but the archive of student Korsakow projects generated via the curriculum begins to generate some paths for possible answers.

### "Iterative Progress"

* Creator: Justin Lincoln (Whitman College)

This resource and the pedagogy it represents fall squarely on the post-cinematic side of our digital video collection. Assignments range from glitching images to processing-based animations to remix video responses. The materials provide an invitation to experiment with the dynamics of signal and noise, using videos to explore the role of machinic processing and social media in composing. By using sites like Tumblr as collection engines for video materials and by teaching students non-traditional methods of composing, Lincoln’s pedagogy enacts a video paradigm built around the shifting relationships between humans and technology. While instructors might cull assignments or examples from the Tumblr, the site (and Lincoln’s [Notational Tumblr](http://notational.tumblr.com) might best be used as illustrative examples/enactments of how video pedagogy and the New Aesthetic can come together. In describing the New Aesthetic, Bruce Sterling asserts that “[w]e’re surrounded by systems, devices and machineries generating heaps of raw graphic novelty. We built them, we programmed them, we set them loose for a variety of motives, but they do some unexpected and provocative things” (n.p.). With this in mind, the pedagogical outcome(s) for a blending of video pedagogy and the New Aesthetic is an increased awareness of how these systems, devices, and machineries, along with ourselves, might participate in a larger field of relations.

### "Introduction to Humanities Physical Computing w/Arduino and Processing"

If Adrian Miles’s curriculum for post-industrial video and Justin Lincoln’s new genres course Tumblr offer a glimpse towards the future of video under the influence of software and digital networks, then David Reider’s course syllabus for “Introduction to Humanities Physical Computing w/Arduino and Processing” presents an introductory curriculum to the emerging disciplinary orientations from which new processes and conceptions for video might emerge. Reider’s course does not specifically take up video; however, it does offer a map for both a theoretical and a hands-on introduction to “the computational and physical/material bases of electronic media.” We have included it here as a provocation of sorts. For example, while most syllabi frame video projects as “Video Essays” or “Mashups” (both relatively recognizable products), the projects in Reider’s course include such things as a “Sensable Object.” Certainly, films and videos of all stripes operate via affective dimensions, but how many are sensible objects, “interactive sound and light show[s] with sensor, buttons, and switches.” Why not, in an era of drones and facial recognition software, imagine and seek to build a video that could be such a thing? Reider’s pedagogy prompts us to attempt to experiment with a video practice suited as much to the reality of ubiquitous computing as to the legacy of industrialization. Reider has also taught an [undergraduate variation](http://siteslab.org/resources/IP_295_001_RIEDER.pdf) of this course.
